# Financial-Risk-Detection
 This project combines EDA and machine learning to predict loan defaults for a consumer finance company. Analyzing historical loan data reveals patterns indicating potential defaulters. By minimizing financial losses and avoiding unfair rejections, this analysis aids in efficient risk management.

# Loan Default Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict loan defaults using machine learning techniques. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical data on loan applications, including various features such as borrower information, loan details, and credit scores.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigated the distribution of features, identified correlations, and visualized patterns in the data.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Engineered new features and performed preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Model Selection:** Experimented with several machine learning models including logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Tuned hyperparameters to improve performance.

## Results
The Random Forest model outperformed other classifiers with an accuracy of 85% in predicting loan defaults. Insights from EDA guided feature selection and preprocessing steps, contributing to model effectiveness.

## Future Work
1. Implement real-time risk assessment systems for continuous model updates.
2. Enhance data quality and explore additional feature engineering techniques to further optimize predictive accuracy.
3. Deploy the model into production for automated loan default predictions.
